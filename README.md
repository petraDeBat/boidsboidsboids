# boidsboidsboids

Welcome to the boidsboidsboids project! 🐦✨ This project is an interactive bird flocking simulation built using p5.js. Watch as the birds (boids) fly around, avoid collisions, and form beautiful flocks. You can even adjust various parameters to see how they affect the flocking behavior!

## Features

- Realistic bird flocking behavior using Craig Reynolds' boids algorithm 🕊️
- Adjustable parameters for separation, cohesion, alignment, speed, detection radius, and more 🎛️
- Energy management system for the boids ⚡
- Birds can land on power lines to rest and regain energy 🪶
- Interactive sliders to control the simulation in real-time 🎚️
- Debug mode to visualize the boids' detection and separation radii 🧐

## Running the Simulation

To run the simulation, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You can also view the simulation online using the GitHub Pages link below.
